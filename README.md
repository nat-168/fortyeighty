# Data
Data excluded, but its management is clearly visible throughout my work (visualization, cleanup, breaks, etc.)

# Final Project
[**Health of College Students (2023)**](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/cca39c62879945b1aadff19591a3f9bd) is a geographical analysis of the predicted health of college campuses across the US, based on assumptions about the environmental/geographical factors impacting both physical and mental health of students.

# Subsequent Project
[**Linked (NTRES 3330 Maps.pdf)**](./NTRES%203330%20Maps.pdf) are figures I made for a later project for Cornell's NTRES 3330 (Fall 2024) about photography on Cornell's campus
